# Table: Views

# +---------------+---------+
# | Column Name   | Type    |
# +---------------+---------+
# | article_id    | int     |
# | author_id     | int     |
# | viewer_id     | int     |
# | view_date     | date    |
# +---------------+---------+
# There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
# Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
# Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

# Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

# Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# Views table:
# +------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
# | article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
# +------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
# | 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
# | 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
# | 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
# | 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
# | 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
# | 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
# | 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
# +------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
# Output: 
# +------+
# | id   |
# +------+
# | 4    |
# | 7    |

# My Solution in Pandas

import pandas as pd

def article_views(views: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Authors who viewed their own articles 
    author_own_view_df = views[views['author_id'] == views['viewer_id']]

    # Get Unique Author IDs 
    unique_view_df = author_own_view_df['author_id'].unique()

    #Sort the results in ascending order
    sorted_own_view_df = sorted(unique_view_df)

    # Create result Data Frame with new column as id
    result_df = pd.DataFrame({'id': sorted_own_view_df})

    #return the final result 
    return result_df
